        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          I am a highly motivated and professional graduate with teaching experience dating from the first year of my undergraduate degree. I have teaching experience from Primary (KS1) up to adult level. I have a very calm and patient manner with
          excellent communication and listening skills.</p>
        <p>
          I am a member of Global Shapers, an initiative backed by the World Economic Forum, the Global Shapers Community is a network of hubs developed and led by young people, primarily between the ages of 20 and 30 who are exceptional in their
          potential, their achievements and their drive to make a difference in their communities.

        <h3>Climate Reality Leadership</h3>
        <p>On the 26th July 2020, I finished the training of the Climate Reality Leadership Corps and become an official Climate Activist. I emphasise "official" because before this training, I have been focus on working with environmental education.
          Now I will have more knowledge and capacity to be an advocate for Climate Justice. I learned throughout the course that climate change is a global issue but affects the minorities and marginal communities more intensely.</p>
        <p>
          Moving to Egypt around a year ago, from the moment I stepped in this land, I noticed that care for the environment is an afterthought. It is common to see piles of trash on the street, floating on the sea and being burned as a way to get
          rid of it. People are not aware of how this affects them <strong>and</strong> that they have the power to make a difference. As a Global Shaper and a Biologist, with a master’s degree in Ecology, this was very unsettling to me. In an
          attempt to improve the environment I have organized beach clean ups and talks to demonstrate how climate change affects us and how little steps in our everyday life make a big difference.</p>
        <p>
          With the existing knowledge from my field of study, along with being a climate advocate, I am convinced that I can help to create better strategies, and will connect me with other inspirational young leaders that I can learn from and
          network with.
